## 🌟 Inspiration
The idea for PerCent came from a common challenge among young adults, especially international students and new professionals: managing finances on their own for the first time. Many of us were used to having our parents handle our finances, so budgeting and saving felt overwhelming. We created PerCent to simplify this journey for everyone, regardless of their experience level.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Our tech stack combines some of the best tools for rapid, scalable app development:
- **Frontend**: React Native and React for a smooth, engaging user experience.
- **Backend**: Express and Redis for robust server-side processing and data management.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **AI & NLP**: Hugging Face integration powers our chatbot, providing smart responses and personalized insights.

With only two team members, we divided tasks effectively to tackle both frontend and backend requirements, ensuring each feature was implemented seamlessly.

## 💪 Challenges We Faced
Building PerCent wasn’t without its challenges:
- **Hardware Issues**: One teammate’s laptop stopped working, so we shared a single device, making collaboration more intense but adding to our teamwork.
- **Compatibility Problems**: Halfway through development, a recent update to Expo and React Native introduced unexpected routing changes, forcing us to rework parts of the app.

## 🏆 Accomplishments We’re Proud Of
Despite these obstacles, we’re proud to have built a functional and impactful app that includes almost every feature we set out to implement. Overcoming technical setbacks and time constraints was a valuable test of our dedication and collaboration.

## 📚 What We Learned

## 🔮 What’s Next for PerCent
